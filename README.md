Support Another transaction functionality, for example, “Do you need another transaction? Press 1 to proceed, press 2 to exit”.

ATM Machine C program:<br/>
The program is really simple to understand. To make the code simple, I used functions to implement this project. I used switch cases, if-else statements, loops and much more.<br/>

Under this walkthrough, we're going to see the code, on a simple ATM Machine in the C programming language. C programming is perfect for beginners and hence my choice to create an ATM Machine program. This one and only program code helps you to cover all essential SKILLS about concepts in programming before proceeding.


Steps on how to run ATM System C Program

I developed this with CodeBlocks IDE so I give a quick guide on how to run the program on your own PC.<br/>
Every other C IDEs also can run this program.

Step 1: Create a new project.
Open the CodeBlocks IDE and click “Create a new project”.

Step 2: Choose a console application.
Click the “console application” and after that click on next.

Step 3: Choose C language.
Choose “C language” and click on next.

Step 4: Name Your Project.
Name the project you’ve created and click “next” After that click on finish.

Step 5: The actual code.
